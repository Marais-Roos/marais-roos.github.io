            <p>
                I am an software developer, web designer and web developer, as well as an copywriter from sunny South Africa.
                <br>
                <br>
                My speciality is C++ Programming, which I have been using for the past five years. I am an C++ Certified Associate 
                Programmer, and currently I am pursuing a certification as an C++ Certified Professional Programmer.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started my programming journey in 2015 when I was in high school. I learned the fundamental notions of programming 
                and computer systems whilst I was in high school, after which I decided to pursue a degree in this science to further 
                deepen my understanding of computers and programming.
                <br>
                <br>
                Life has thrown a fair share of curve balls at me, but with a never-say-die attitude I was able to persevere and make 
                the best from a few messy circumstances.

                After school I enrolled for a Bachelor of Engineering at the University of Pretoria, but the realisation soon set in that 
                I was not cut out for this line of work. I persevered and finished 2018. Afterwards, I then moved on to a Bachelor of Science 
                in Information and Knowledge Systems, majoring in IT & Genetics. Again, I was unable to complete this degree, but this time due 
                to a variety of circumstances I was not able to control, and at the end of 2021, I was forced to stop pursuing this degree.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2022 I decided to do a short course in C++ Programming, because C++ will provide me with a deeper understanding of computers 
                and the way they operate, and I will still be able to live out my passion for programming. In August of 2022 I obtained  my C++ 
                Certified Associate Programmer certification and I am applying the final touches to this course, then I can officially say I am C
                ertified C++ Associate Programmer.

                In my free time, I started to learn more about the science of web development and very soon I adopted a passion for it. The deeper 
                I delved into web development, the more I realised it is an area in which I can express my creativity. I was completely fascinated 
                by this. I was also astonished by the possibilities in may present, which resulted in me learning about the art of web design.
                <br>
                <br>
                I believe a person can never stop learning, and the next step on my journey towards a life time of learning is enrolling for a Bachelor 
                of Science in Computing at the University of South Africa.

            <p>
                As you can see, the cards I have been dealt in life, has been reshuffled quite a few times.
                <br>
                <br>
                I haven't stopped writing my story, and don't tend to stop any time soon - please check in regularly for updates on my programming journey.
